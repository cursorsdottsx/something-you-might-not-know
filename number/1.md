Ever stopped while typing an uppercase (capital) letter in your code and wondered why they're called "uppercase"?

If you haven't, try now! Why is the letter `C` considered uppercase and `c` lowercase? What makes `C` any more "upper" than its counterpart?
You might just think it's called "uppercase" because it's bigger and it's a "case" of being bigger for a particular letter.
This does make sense intuitively; "upper"'s connotation is that of something similar to "superior", "large", or "better".

However the real origin behind uppercase and lowercase letters might surprise you.

Back then in the 15th century, when the first printing presses were used to mass-produce books, operators of the press had to manually place little tiles or stamps with each character on them.
These would be dipped in ink, then pressed onto the paper using the machine to print industrial amounts of pages in a short amount of time.
But where would these blocks be stored?

Cases. They were put away in wooden cases on shelves. If an operator had to use a character, they would find the correct case on the shelf and open it.
I think you know what's coming next. Since lowercase characters were used far more often and frequently, they were the most abundant.
Uppercase characters were only for starting sentences and titles, which meant they were rarer and less used.

Naturally, the operators stored the lowercase characters in the lower case, where it could be accessed easily and used often. The uppercase characters lived above, in the upper case.

So that's why we call them uppercase and lowercase characters. Some operators in the 15th century started being lazy and described them by where they lived on the shelf.

And that is something you might not have known.
